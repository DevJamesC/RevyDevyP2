Stock Jock - Project Description
James Crescenzi, Yujun Chen, Harold Hopson (Group 1)

Stock Jock's mission is to democratize finance for all. We believe that everyone should have access to the financial markets, so weâ€™ve built Stock Jock from a perspective that makes the idea of investing friendly, approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike. Our goal is to build a product that provides everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy. The creation of Stock Jock hopes to leverage technology in such a way as to  encourage everyone to participate in our financial system.
