Stock Jock's mission is to democratize finance for all. 
We believe that everyone should have access to the financial markets, 
so weâ€™ve built Stock Jock from a perspective that makes the idea of investing friendly, 
approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike.
Our goal is to build a product that provides everyone with access to the financial markets, 
not just the wealthy. The creation of Stock Jock hopes to leverage technology in such a way as to 
encourage everyone to participate in our financial system.
